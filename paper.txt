The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, rather than water, as sources of electrons.6 Cyanobacteria appeared later; the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to the oxygenation of the Earth,7 which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130 terawatts,8 9 10 which is about eight times the current power consumption of human civilization.11 Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100–115 billion tons (91–104 petagrams) of carbon into biomass per year.12 13 The phenomenon that plants receive some energy from light – in addition to air, soil, and water – was first discovered in 1779 by Jan Ingenhousz.
